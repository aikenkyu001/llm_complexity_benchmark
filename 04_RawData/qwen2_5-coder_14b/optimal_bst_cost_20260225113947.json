Define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum cost for keys from index `i` to `j`.\nThe cost for a sub-range `dp[i][j]` is the sum of frequencies in that range plus the minimum value of `dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j]` for all possible roots `k` in the range `[i, j]`.\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= n <= 100\n- 1 <= frequencies[i] <= 1000",
