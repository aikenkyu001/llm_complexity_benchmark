Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.\nExtra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.\nFor the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= words.length <= 300\n- 1 <= words[i].length <= 20\n- words[i] consists of only English letters and symbols.\n- 1 <= maxWidth <= 100\n- words[i].length <= maxWidth",
