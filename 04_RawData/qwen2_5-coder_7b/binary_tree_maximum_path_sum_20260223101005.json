A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.\nThe path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.\nGiven the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.\n\nConstraints:\n- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 10^4].\n- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000",
