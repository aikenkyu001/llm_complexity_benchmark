The added edge connects two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed.\nThe resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [ui, vi] that represents a directed edge connecting nodes ui and vi, where ui is a parent of child vi.\nReturn an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the last occurrence in the given 2D-array.\n\nConstraints:\n- n == edges.length\n- 3 <= n <= 1000\n- edges[i].length == 2\n- 1 <= ui, vi <= n",
