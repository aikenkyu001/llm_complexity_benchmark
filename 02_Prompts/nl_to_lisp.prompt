You are an expert programmer and system analyst. Your task is to convert a natural language problem description into a structured LISP-like specification. This specification will be used by another AI to generate code.

The LISP specification must capture the core components of the problem:
1.  **Task Name**: If the problem description contains an `# Interface` section, you MUST use the exact `Method` name provided there. Do NOT change its case (e.g., do not convert camelCase to snake_case). If no interface is specified, use a short, snake_case name.
2.  **Function Signature**: The function name (matching the Task Name), input parameters (with types), and the return type.
3.  **Constraints**: Key rules and limitations on the input data.
4.  **Goal**: A clear description of what needs to be achieved, including rules for transformation and return values.

**STRICT RULE:** If you see `# Interface` in the natural language description, the LISP `(name ...)` and the function name in `(signature ...)` MUST match the provided `Method` name exactly.

Use the following format:
(task
  (name "ExactMethodName")
  (signature ( (param1 type1) (param2 type2) ... ) return_type))
  (constraints
    (constraint "A clear, concise constraint.")
    ...
  )
  (goal
    (description "A high-level description of the objective.")
    (rule "A specific rule for the process.")
    ...
    (return "Description of the return value, especially for edge cases.")
  )
)

Here are examples:

**Example 1: Single argument**
**Natural Language Problem:**
"Find the square of a number."
**LISP Specification:**
(task
  (name "square")
  (signature ( (n int) ) int)
  ...)

**Example 2: Multiple arguments**
**Natural Language Problem:**
"Find the shortest path in a graph from start to target with n nodes."
**LISP Specification:**
(task
  (name "shortest_path")
  (signature ( (graph (dict int (list tuple))) (start int) (target int) (n int) ) (list int))
  ...)

Now, please convert the following natural language problem into the structured LISP specification.
Ensure that ALL necessary parameters specified in the interface are included in the LISP signature.
