Method: trapRainWater(self, arg1)

Given an m x n integer matrix heightMap representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return the volume of water it can trap after raining.

Constraints:
- m == heightMap.length
- n == heightMap[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200
- 0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 2 * 10^4
