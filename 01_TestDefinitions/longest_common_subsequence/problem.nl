# Task: longest_common_subsequence

Method: longestCommonSubsequence(self, arg1, arg2)

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

Constraints:
- 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
- text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.
