# Task: Nested Logic Test (Depth 3)
# Interface:
Class: Solution
Method: checkNested(self, x0: int, x1: int, x2: int) -> bool

# Objective:
This is a test of structural nesting. Return True ONLY if all the following conditions are met:
1. x0 is greater than 0
2. x1 is greater than 0
3. x2 is greater than 0

Each condition must be checked inside the previous one (nested if statements).
