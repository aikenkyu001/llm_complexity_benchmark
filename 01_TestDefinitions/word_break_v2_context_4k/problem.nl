# Task: word_break_v2_context_4k

Class: Solution
Method: wordBreak(self, arg1, arg2, arg3)

[SYSTEM SPECIFICATION - CONTEXT SCALING TEST v1.4]
... (This problem description is intentionally elongated with redundant but necessary technical specifications to test context handling up to 4000 tokens) ...
The task is Word Break: Given string s and dictionary wordDict, return true if s can be segmented.
ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- You must use a Trie-based DP approach.
- You must log each successful split point (assume a logger `self.log_split(index)`).
- Handle the case where the dictionary contains empty strings by ignoring them.
- If multiple segmentations exist, the one with the fewest words is preferred (though the return is still boolean).
... (imagine 3000 more tokens of detailed architectural constraints here) ...
Final Goal: Implement `wordBreak(s, wordDict)`.
