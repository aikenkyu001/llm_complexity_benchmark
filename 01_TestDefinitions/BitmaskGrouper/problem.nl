# Task: BitmaskGrouper
# Interface:
Class: Solution
Method: groupNums(self, arg1)

Given an array of integers `nums`, group the elements into the smallest number of groups such that each group contains elements whose bitwise AND is non-zero.
Return the groups as a list of lists. (If multiple groupings exist with the same minimum number, any one is acceptable).

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
