# Task: Nested Logic Test (Depth 15)
# Interface:
Class: Solution
Method: checkNested(self, x0: int, x1: int, x2: int, x3: int, x4: int, x5: int, x6: int, x7: int, x8: int, x9: int, x10: int, x11: int, x12: int, x13: int, x14: int) -> bool

# Objective:
This is a test of structural nesting. Return True ONLY if all the following conditions are met:
1. x0 is greater than 0
2. x1 is greater than 0
3. x2 is greater than 0
4. x3 is greater than 0
5. x4 is greater than 0
6. x5 is greater than 0
7. x6 is greater than 0
8. x7 is greater than 0
9. x8 is greater than 0
10. x9 is greater than 0
11. x10 is greater than 0
12. x11 is greater than 0
13. x12 is greater than 0
14. x13 is greater than 0
15. x14 is greater than 0

Each condition must be checked inside the previous one (nested if statements).
