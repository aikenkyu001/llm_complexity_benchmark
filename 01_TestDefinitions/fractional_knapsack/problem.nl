# Task: fractional_knapsack
# Interface:
Class: Solution
Method: fractionalKnapsack(self, arg1, arg2)

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack of a given capacity, find the maximum total value you can carry. In the fractional knapsack problem, you can break items for maximizing the total value.
Items are given as a list of pairs: `(value, weight)`.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= capacity <= 10^7
- 1 <= value, weight <= 1000
