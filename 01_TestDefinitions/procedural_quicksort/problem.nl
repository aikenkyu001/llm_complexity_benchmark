# Task: procedural_quicksort
# Interface:
Class: Solution
Method: quickSort(self, arg1)

Implement the QuickSort algorithm procedurally. The function should take an array of integers and sort it in ascending order in-place.
You should use a partition scheme (e.g., Lomuto or Hoare partition).
Note: The problem is focused on the correct implementation of the sorting logic, not just using built-in `.sort()`.

Constraints:
- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
