# Task: matrix_chain_multiplication
# Interface:
Class: Solution
Method: matrixChainOrder(self, arg1)

Given a list of matrix dimensions, find the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply the sequence of matrices.
If the sequence of matrices is A1, A2, ..., An, where Ai has dimensions `p[i-1] x p[i]`, the input is the list `p = [p0, p1, ..., pn]`.

Constraints:
- 2 <= p.length <= 100
- 1 <= p[i] <= 100
